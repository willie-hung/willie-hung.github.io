        <p class="is-size-3">State</p>
        <div class="box content">
          <p>
            State is isolated between components. React keeps track of which
            state belongs to which component
            <strong>based on their place in the UI tree</strong>.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="is-size-3">What is UI Tree?</p>
        <div class="box content">
          <p>
            React makes UI trees from your JSX/TSX. Then React DOM updates the
            browser DOM elements to match that UI tree.
          </p>
          <div class="is-flex is-justify-content-center is-align-items-center">
            <figure class="image column is-two-thirds">
              <image src="./figures/post16/figure1.jpg" />
            </figure>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="is-size-3">State is tied to a position in the tree</p>
        <div class="box content">
          <p>
            When you assign state to a component, you may assume that the state
            resides within the component itself. However, in reality, React
            manages and stores the state. Each piece of state is associated with
            the corresponding component based on its
            <strong>position</strong> in the UI tree.
          </p>
          <p>Take a look at the code snippet below:</p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Willie-The-Lord/b9a2918cc04d884c4a649aa9bb8c85a7.js"></script>
          <p>
            There is only one Counter tsx, but it rendered at two different
            positions. The state of the Counter component is tied to its place
            in the UI tree. So they each have their own state (6 & 9).
          </p>
          <div class="is-flex is-justify-content-center is-align-items-center">
            <figure class="image column is-one-fifth">
              <image src="./figures/post16/figure2.png" />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p class="is-size-5">Delete the component</p>
          <p>
            However, if you stop rendering the component (for example, by
            deleting it), its state will be <strong>completely removed</strong>.
            This occurs because when React unmounts a component, it also
            destroys its state.

            Remember that it’s <strong>the position in the UI tree</strong>—not
            in the JSX markup—that matters to React!

            Here, you switch between
            <strong>different component types (Counter -> p)</strong> at the
            same position. React removed the Counter from the UI tree and
            destroyed its state.

            If you aim to maintain the state between re-renders, it is essential
            for
            <strong
              >the structure of your component tree to remain consistent</strong
            >
            from one render to another. If the structure changes, React will
            remove the component from the tree and, consequently, destroy its
            associated state.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p class="is-size-3">Resetting state at the same position</p>
        <div class="box content">
          <p>
            By default, React preserves the state of a component as long as it
            remains in the same position within its parent. This behavior aligns
            with the typical use case and is generally desired. However, there
            are situations where you might need to
            <strong>reset a component's state intentionally</strong>.
          </p>
          <p class="is-size-5">
            Option 1: Rendering a component in different positions

          <p>
            This solution is convenient when you only have a few independent
            components rendered in the same place. In this example, you only
            have two, so it’s not a hassle to render both separately in the JSX.
          </p>
          <p class="is-size-5">Option 2: Resetting state with a key</p>
          <p>

          <p>
            By specifying a key, React
            <strong
              >utilizes the key itself as a means of identifying the component's
              position</strong
            >, rather than relying on their order within the parent.
            Consequently, even if you render them in the same location in JSX,
            React recognizes them as two distinct counters. As a result, they
            will never share state since their keys serve as unique identifiers
            in the virtual DOM.

        <div class="box content">
          <p>
            In React, each piece of state is associated with the corresponding
            component based on its <strong>position</strong> in the UI tree. To
            maintain state between re-renders, it is crucial for the structure
            of your component tree to remain consistent across renders. If the
            structure changes, React will remove the component from the tree
            and, consequently, destroy its associated state. This is a breif
            summary of the article. If you want to know more, please check out
