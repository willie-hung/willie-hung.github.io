          <h3 class="title is-size-5">What is Node.js?</h3>
          <p>
            Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It
            executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. It uses an
            event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and
            efficient.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-size-5">JavaScript</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is a synchronous, blocking, single-threaded language.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-size-5">The synchronous nature</h3>
          <p>
            In the code below, the <code>first function</code>is logged then the
            <code>second function</code> is logged. This is because JavaScript
            is synchronous. It executes code line by line. What if the first
            function is a long-running function? The second function will have
            to wait until the first function is done. This is called
            <strong>blocking</strong>. The second function is blocked by the the
            first function 😔. This is not ideal because it makes the program
            slow and unresponsive.
          </p>

        <h2 class="title is-size-4">Node.js Runtime</h2>
        <div class="box content">
          <p>
            Here, Node.js comes to the rescue. Node.js is
            <strong>asynchronous</strong> and <strong>non-blocking</strong>. It
            uses a single thread to handle multiple requests. It provides us
            with several APIs that allow us to make asynchronous calls.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take a look at the high-level architecture of Node.js. This is
            an image from

            <figure class="image column is-one-third">
              <image src="./figures/post33/figure1.webp" />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            At its core, the Node runtime consists of three major components.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A JavaScript library that provides functions and utilities to tap
              into the C++ features from your JavaScript code
            </li>
            <li>
              C++ features that provide for functionality such as file system
              access and networking
            </li>
            <li>
              External dependencies — such as V8, libuv, crypto — required by
              Node.js for its functioning
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While all the parts are important, the key component for
            asynchronous programming in Node.js is the external dependency,
            <strong>libuv</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3 class="title is-size-5">What is libuv?</h3>
          <div class="is-flex is-justify-content-center is-align-items-center">
            <figure class="image column is-one-third">
              <image src="./figures/post33/figure2.png" />
            </figure>
          </div>
          <p>
            Libuv is a multi-platform C library that provides support for
            <strong>asynchronous I/O based on event loops</strong>. In the
            Node.js runtime, its role is to provide support for handling
            asynchronous operations. To dive deeper into libuv,
            <a
              href="https://www.scaler.com/topics/nodejs/libuv/"
              target="_blank"
              >this article</a
            >
            is a great start. In short though, Libuv helps nodejs to perform
            these operations asynchronously and speed up the efficiency as well
            as performance whereas the main thread handles the operation and
            other workers complete the task. Libuv helps nodejs to enable smooth
            asynchronous operation.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title is-size-5">What is event loop?</h3>
          <p>
            When Node.js starts, it initializes the event loop,
            <strong>processes the provided input script</strong> which may make
            async API calls, schedule timers, or call process.nextTick(), then
            begins processing the event loop.
          </p>

          <p>
            The following diagram shows a simplified overview of the event
            loop's order of operations.
          </p>
          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Willie-The-Lord/f1f60b4243f19af0cd8bce3f3e092bcd.js"></script>
          <p>
            Each phase has a
            <strong>FIFO queue of callbacks to execute</strong>. When the queue
            has been exhausted or the callback limit is reached, the event loop
            will move to the next phase, and so on.
          </p>

          <h3 class="title is-size-5">In action</h3>
          <p>
            Let's take a look at the code below. This is a typical asynchronous
            code.
          </p>

          <script src="https://gist.github.com/Willie-The-Lord/687a5ef2512323e3233712625d1e75cd.js"></script>
          <p>Let's break it down step by step.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The first console log statement is executed and "Hello from the
              first function" is logged on the console. This task is then
              completed and popped from the call stack.
            </li>
            <li>
              The setTimeout function is encountered, and its callback function
              is scheduled to run after a specified delay (in this case, 1000
              ms). The setTimeout task is pushed to the queue,
              <strong>and the function continues to the next task</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The third console log statement is executed, and "Hello from the
              third function" is logged on the console. This task is completed
              and popped from the call stack.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong
                >Meanwhile, the event loop constantly checks if the call stack
                is empty.</strong
              >
              When the timer set by the setTimeout function runs out (i.e.,
              after 1000 ms), the callback function for the setTimeout task is
              sent to the <strong>event queue</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The event loop identifies that the call stack is empty and
              retrieves the next task from the event queue, which is the
              callback function for the setTimeout.
            </li>
            <li>
              The callback function is then pushed to the call stack and
              executed. "Hello from the second function" is logged on the
              console, and this task is subsequently popped from the call stack.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            This is a very simple example of how the event loop works. In
            reality, the event loop is much more complex. For example, the event
            loop has multiple phases, and each phase has its own queue. Checkout
